The raise.dev's goal is to help developers to find their direction in the tech
industry. I think it is much needed. The career letter is getting crazy every
day more. New job titles come and go daily, and it is hard to figure where you
want to go.

I didn't have the opportunity to share during the interview, but I think it is
essential to mention the advantage you get in life when you know what you DO NOT
like. I am far away from that. I am starting to feel about it, but I am not that
close to saying: "I don't like YAML." As soon as you know what you dislike, it
is time to move on and leave it out of your life very quickly. In tech, it can
be a technology or a way of thinking.
